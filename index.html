                 <h2>it's not just going to school. it's learning life</h2>
                <p>The Patiño School of Entrepreneurship 
                is a new model for secondary education.
                It’s an applied entrepreneurship school
                that fosters real world skills — critical 
                thinking, problem solving, and 
                collaboration — and as seniors, students launch 
                their own companies.</p>
        
        <h2>Thinking Outside The Box</h2>
           <p>As a foundation for learning, students begin
            mastering technology: computer literacy, web
            navigation, website creation, online marketing and 
            coding.  By graduation, students will have developed,
            pitched, and started their own business, and in the process 
            will have learned valuable life and career skills, including 
            working in teams, thinking critically, analyzing data, leading,
            navigating technology, prioritizing, making decisions, and 
            negotiating.Students learn to work hard, think outside 
            of the boundaries, be team players, and not be afraid to try new things.</p>

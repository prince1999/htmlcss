						<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>As an applied entrepreneurship high school, this school equips young entrepreneurs to thrive. Our curriculum centers on integrated project-based learning that fosters real world skills â€” critical thinking, problem solving, and collaboration. Like a traditional high school, we offer advanced courses, access to extracurricular activities, and special education support. Graduates can pursue college, career, or both. However, here, students direct their education based on their passion. We provide an open, innovative, and fun atmosphere, flexible schedule, and inspiring instructors. By the time students graduate, they will have developed, pitched, and launched their own companies.</p>
